# common

This folder contains shared logic and utilities that are **used across multiple features**.

## Subfolders:
- `api/`: Contains reusable API service logic like `axios` instances or HTTP helpers.
- `composables/`: Vue composables (`useX`) that are generic and not tied to any single feature.
- `exceptions/`: Custom error classes or error-handling utilities shared app-wide.
