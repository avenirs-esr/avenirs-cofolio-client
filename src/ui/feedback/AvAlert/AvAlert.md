# Alerts - `AvAlert`

## üåü Introduction

The `AvAlert` component is an adaptation of the `DsfrAlert` code. It is intended for use in the `AvToaster` component.

Alerts draw the user attention to information without interrupting their current task.

The alert is available in two sizes:

- medium size (MD, by default, if the `small` prop is absent or set to `false`) and
- small size (SM) if the `small` prop is set to `true`.

üèÖ The documentation for `DsfrAlert` can be found at [VueDSFR](https://vue-ds.fr/composants/DsfrAlert)

## üìê Structure

The alert consists of the following elements:
- a title (prop `title`, of type `string`):
  - mandatory on the MD version (if the `small` prop is absent or set to `false`),
  - optional on the SM version (if the `small` prop is set to `true`).
- an icon and a color determined by the `type` prop, which can be one of the following strings:
  - `info` (default value if the `type` prop is absent)
  - `success`
  - `warning`
  - `error`
- a description text (with the `description` prop, of type `string`):
  - optional on the MD version
  - mandatory on the SM version
  - the default `slot` can be used as a description
- a closing cross if the `closeable` prop is set to `true`

Other props:
- `closed` is used to indicate whether the alert should be present (`false`) or not (`true`) in the DOM.
- `titleTag` specifies the tag to use for the `title`: this is `h3` by default, however, to pass RGAA tests, the heading levels must be consecutive and consistent (for example, if there is no `<h2>` on the page, you must pass `'h2'` as the value to the `titleTag` prop so that the modal title is `<h2>`).
- `closeButtonLabel` specifies the label and aria-label of the alert close button. By default, the value is `Close`.
