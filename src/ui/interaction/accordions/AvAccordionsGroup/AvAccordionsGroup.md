# Accordions group - `AvAccordionsGroup`

## üåü Introduction

The `AvAccordionsGroup` component implements VueDSFR `DsfrAccordionsGroup` while automatically managing the addition of `DsfrAccordion` according to the `AvAccordion` present in the `default` slot.

Accordions allow users to show and hide sections of content presented on a page.

The accordions group lets you group several accordions into a single coherent unit. It manages active selection logic between child accordions, allowing you to open one accordion while closing the others. This component is essential for organizing interactively linked accordion sets.
