# Avenirs Cofolio Client

The Avenirs Cofolio project is a comprehensive portfolio management system designed to support lifelong portfolio development for citizens. It aims to:

- Enable continuity in portfolio approaches throughout a citizen's life
- Facilitate awareness, recognition, and promotion of skills and competencies
- Support the development of life projects (personal, educational, career orientation, professional development, and civic engagement)

## Project Architecture

The project follows a feature-based architecture with a clear separation of concerns:

### Feature-Based Organization

Each feature module (`student`, `teacher`) follows a consistent internal structure:

```
features/
â”œâ”€â”€ student/                 # Student module
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/          # Student-specific UI components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ composables/         # Student-specific Vue composition functions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/             # Layout structures for student views
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ queries/             # Data fetching logic using TanStack Query
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ views/               # Student page components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts             # Module entry point and exports
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ routes.ts            # Student route definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ teacher/                 # Teacher module
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/          # Teacher-specific UI components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ composables/         # Teacher-specific Vue composition functions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/             # Layout structures for teacher views
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ queries/             # Teacher-specific data fetching
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ views/               # Teacher page components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...                  # Similar structure as student module
```

This modular approach ensures that:
- Each user role has dedicated, purpose-built interfaces
- Code is organized by domain rather than technical function
- Features can be developed, tested, and maintained independently
- Clear boundaries exist between different parts of the application

### Commit conventions

This repository uses [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) to enforce consistent and conventional commit messages.

This setup extends the conventional commit configuration (`@commitlint/config-conventional`) and adds custom rules:

âœ… Allowed Commit Types

The following commit types are allowed:

- `feat` â€“ A new feature
- `fix` â€“ A bug fix
- `docs` â€“ Documentation changes
- `refactor` â€“ Code refactoring (no feature or bug fix)
- `test` â€“ Adding or modifying tests
- `build` â€“ Changes to build tools or dependencies
- `revert` â€“ Revert a previous commit
